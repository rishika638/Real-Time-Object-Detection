Real-Time Object Detection
A high-performance, scalable, and production-ready Real-Time Object Detection Application leveraging the power of YOLOv5 and Streamlit. This project showcases a robust combination of cutting-edge machine learning techniques and user-friendly web application design.

Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Detect objects in uploaded images with precision using YOLOv5.
Pretrained Model Integration: Utilizes the pretrained yolov5s.pt model for efficient and accurate predictions.
Interactive User Interface: A modern, interactive web app built with Streamlit for seamless user experience.
Deployment-Ready: Fully deployable on Streamlit Cloud, ensuring public accessibility.

Technologies Used

Machine Learning
YOLOv5: State-of-the-art object detection framework for identifying objects with speed and accuracy.
PyTorch: Backbone library for model loading and inference.

Web Development
Streamlit: Lightweight and fast framework for creating data apps.

Image Processing
OpenCV: Used for advanced image preprocessing and rendering.
Pillow: Python Imaging Library for handling image I/O.

How It Works
Model Loading:
The application leverages YOLOv5's pretrained yolov5s.pt weights, optimized for general-purpose object detection.

Frontend Workflow:
Users upload an image via the Streamlit interface.
The app displays the detected objects with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.

Backend Processing:
The image is processed using OpenCV.
The YOLOv5 model runs inference to identify objects.

Output:
The final image with detected objects is displayed directly in the web app.

Uses:
Surveillance Systems: Detect intrusions or track objects in security feeds.
Autonomous Vehicles: Object detection for navigation and safety.
